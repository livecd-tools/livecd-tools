pull request at github.

 https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/livecd.lists.fedoraproject.org/

If you have a number of patches and want to have them pulled from a
public git repository, please post a pointer to it as well as sending
each of the patches individually to the list.  Note that the
combination of git-format-patch and git-send-email works well for
sending a series of patches which you have in a local repository.
